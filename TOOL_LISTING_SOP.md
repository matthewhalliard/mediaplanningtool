# Media Planning Tool Listing SOP
## Standard Operating Procedure for Adding New Tools to the Directory

This guide outlines the complete process for researching, analyzing, and creating high-quality listings for media planning tools in the directory. The system now includes **automated logo integration** via Clearbit API, eliminating the need for manual logo management.

## Automated Logo System üé®

### Logo Integration Overview
The directory now features **automated logo loading** using the Clearbit API:

- **Automatic Logo Fetching**: Logos are automatically pulled from company URLs using Clearbit's logo service
- **Smart Domain Extraction**: The system intelligently extracts the correct domain from complex URLs
- **3-Tier Fallback System**: Ensures every tool always displays a professional image
- **No Manual Work Required**: Simply provide the company URL in the `link` field

### How Logo System Works
1. **Primary**: Clearbit logo from company domain (`https://logo.clearbit.com/domain.com`)
2. **Secondary**: UI Avatars with company initials and branded colors
3. **Tertiary**: Text-based display with company name

### Special Domain Handling
The system automatically handles complex URLs:
- `advertising.amazon.com` ‚Üí `amazon.com` (for Amazon DSP)
- `business.facebook.com` ‚Üí `facebook.com` (for Meta Business Manager)
- `business.linkedin.com` ‚Üí `linkedin.com` (for LinkedIn Campaign Manager)
- `ads.tiktok.com` ‚Üí `tiktok.com` (for TikTok Ads Manager)
- `marketingplatform.google.com` ‚Üí `google.com` (for Google DV360)
- `business.adobe.com` ‚Üí `adobe.com` (for Adobe Advertising Cloud)

### Logo Requirements for New Tools
- ‚úÖ **Required**: Valid company URL in the `link` field
- ‚úÖ **Automatic**: Logo fetching handled by the system
- ‚ùå **Not Required**: Manual logo upload or image files
- ‚ùå **Not Required**: Logo field in frontmatter (system uses URL)

## Step 1: Initial Research with Perplexity

Use the Perplexity MCP to gather comprehensive background information about the tool.

### Research Questions to Ask:

9. **Blog/Resources** - Recent content showing thought leadership and benchmarks

### Firecrawl Implementation:
```typescript
// Example scraping workflow
1. Scrape homepage for main value proposition
2. Scrape /features or /product for detailed capabilities
3. Scrape /pricing for cost information
4. Scrape /about for company background
5. Extract key messaging and unique selling points
```

## Step 3: Content Analysis and Synthesis
